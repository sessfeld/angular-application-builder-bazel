# Disabling pnpm [hoisting](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) by setting `hoist=false` is recommended on
# projects using rules_js so that pnpm outside of Bazel lays out a node_modules tree similar to what
# rules_js lays out under Bazel (without a hidden node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules)

# Bazel manages lifecycle scripts for us. When we run pnpm outside of Bazel,
